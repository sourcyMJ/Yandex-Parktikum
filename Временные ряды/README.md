Forecasting taxi orders (Topic: time series)

Task:
* Develop a model for predicting the number of taxi rides in the next hour

Project description:
* It is necessary to analyze historical data on the number of taxi orders at airports. Based on the results of the analysis, it is necessary to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour in order to attract more drivers during peak demand periods. The model prediction error (RMSE) should not exceed 48.

Stack:
* Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, gradient boosting (lightgbm)
